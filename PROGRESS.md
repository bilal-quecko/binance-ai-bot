## No. 1 — AI Advisory History Persistence

- Status: Completed
- Scope:
  - persisted symbol-scoped AI advisory snapshots in SQLite
  - added duplicate suppression on materially unchanged advisory outputs
  - exposed latest/history AI advisory API endpoints
  - added Signal-tab AI history UI for the selected symbol
- Backend:
  - added `ai_signal_snapshots` storage with repository methods for insert/latest/history/count
  - persisted AI snapshots on closed-candle processing after the advisory signal is recomputed
  - suppressed inserts when bias, confidence, entry/exit flags, suggested action, explanation, and compact feature summary are unchanged
- Frontend:
  - added symbol-scoped AI Signal history section with confidence trend, bias/action history, and recent advisory snapshots
  - kept empty states and in-place refresh behavior for the workstation UX
- Validation:
  - backend tests: `55 passed`
  - frontend helper tests: passed
  - frontend production build: passed
